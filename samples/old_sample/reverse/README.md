# reverse

This is a sample exercise, for demonstrating how the badkan works. The exercise is:

> Write a C++ unit named "reverse" (files reverse.h and reverse.cpp)
with a single function named "reverse"
that accepts a string and returns it in reverse.

A sample solution can be found at:

The subfolders whose name starts with "solution-" are not a part of the exercise - they are sample solutions to the exercise that receive different grades.
